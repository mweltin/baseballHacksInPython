**Baseball Hacks In Python**

The book "Baseball Hacks" by Joseph Alder is a great read for anyone interest in the
baseball analytics.  The only strike against it is the fact that all the hacks are 
written in Perl.  Perl is a language I'm just not that comfortable with.  This repo is 
ports some of the more useful hacks I found in that book to python.

Answer the prompts, naming the user 'bbhip' and allowing it to create databases

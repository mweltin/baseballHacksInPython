**CUBS: Completely Useless Baseball Statistics**

The book "Baseball Hacks" by Joseph Alder is a great read for anyone interest in the
baseball analytics.  It was the inpsiration for this repo.  The only strike against it
is the fact that all the hacks are written in Perl.  Perl is a language I'm just 
not that comfortable with.  This repo is ports some of the more useful hacks I found in that book to python.

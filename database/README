You can use the image mweltin/bbhip-1 on dockerHub it contains a dump of the database as of 7/29/2020

The image assume there is a directory /opt/bbhip/data that is empty when the image is run

Running this image will create all the postgres data files on in /opt/bbhip/data 

it will also create the bbhip database and populate it with data. 

If you want to build the image yourself you will need to create the database and take a 

compressed dump of the data, name the file bbhip.dump and add it to the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d 

directory.
